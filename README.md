# 🩺 Lung Cancer Detection Project

## 📌 Overview
Lung cancer is one of the most prevalent and life-threatening diseases worldwide. This project aims to provide an **ML-powered Lung Cancer Detection system** based on patient symptoms and medical history. Users can input their details, and the model predicts the probability of lung cancer.

## 🚀 Features
- **User Input Form**: Collects age, gender, smoking habits, persistent cough, chest pain, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Trained on medical data to predict lung cancer likelihood.
- **Data Visualization**: Graphs and trends showing symptom analysis.
- **Prediction History**: Saves user results for future reference.
- **PDF Report Generation**: Users can download their diagnosis report.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Manage user data and predictions.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Database**: SQLite / MySQL
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🔧 Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/vansh070605/LUNG-CANCER-DETECTOR.git
   cd LUNG-CANCER-DETECTOR
   ```
2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Run the Flask application**

   python app.py
   ```
5. **Access the application** at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

## 📊 Machine Learning Model
- **Algorithm Used**: Decision Tree / Random Forest / Logistic Regression
- **Training Dataset**: Collected from medical databases
- **Accuracy**: XX% (Mention model performance metrics)

## 🏗 Future Enhancements
- ✅ Add support for **CT scan image analysis**
