            <p class="intro-text">
                Lung Cancer Detection is a web application designed to help detect lung cancer based on
                user input, including symptoms, medical history, and lifestyle factors. The system uses
                advanced machine learning algorithms to provide an estimated likelihood of lung cancer.

                <h3>Purpose</h3>
                <p>
                    The purpose of this project is to create an easy-to-use, accurate, and fast lung cancer 
                    detection tool. It aims to raise awareness about lung cancer and help users identify
                    possible symptoms that might require further medical attention.

                <h3>How It Works</h3>
                <p>
                    The application uses data provided by the user, such as age, smoking habits, and specific
                    symptoms to estimate the risk of lung cancer. The backend uses machine learning models
                    trained on large datasets to calculate the probability of lung cancer based on user inputs.
